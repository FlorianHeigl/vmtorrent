#THis is a sample peers file
#the file should contain entries of hostnames and port numbers of the peers
#to connect to. For now, the interface assumes that the remote peer is already
#running, and tries to connect once on startup.
#THe file should contain lines in the form of: 
hp05.ncl.cs.columbia.edu:6990
#OR:
hp05.ncl.cs.columbia.edu
#If no port is specified the default 6881 will be used
